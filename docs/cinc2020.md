# CinC2020

This document gives an example on how to use the PhysioPro framework for [Classification of 12-lead ECGs: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2020/).

The example is based the solution of the 1st ranked team [Prna](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9344053).
